# Behaviorial Cloning Project

[![Udacity - Self-Driving Car NanoDegree](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-sdc/github/shield-carnd.svg)](http://www.udacity.com/drive)

Overview
---
This Project is submitted as part of the Udacity Self-Driving Car Nanodegree.

For it, the goal is to train, validate and test a Neural Network model using Keras. The model will output a steering angle to an autonomous vehicle. 
The intent is to clone driving behavior, hence the training data set for the model will be created by using a simulator where an operator can steer a car around a track for data collection. The same simulator will then be fed with the output of the trained model, to operate autonomously.

To complete the project, few files are are submitted as part of this Git repo: 

1. An [annotated writeup](./Behavioral_writeup.md) describing the fundamental aspects and limitations of the solution implemented;
2. A [Python script](./model.py), that is used to train the network;
3. A [Model file](./model.h5), output of the training process;
4. A [Python script](./drive.py), (provided by Udacity) that is used to exercise the model autonomously;
5. A [Video](./video.mp4), obtaining through a screen capturing of the simulator while driving autonomously.

Dependencies:
---
In order to run the code provided you will need to properly set up your environment. The refence for this is provided through the Udacity Starter Kit available [here](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit).

The simulator can be downloaded from the classroom. In the classroom, we have also provided sample data that you can optionally use to help train your model.

## Details About Files In This Directory

### `drive.py`

Usage of `drive.py` requires you have saved the trained model as an h5 file, i.e. `model.h5`. See the [Keras documentation](https://keras.io/getting-started/faq/#how-can-i-save-a-keras-model) for how to create this file using the following command:
```sh
model.save(filepath)
```

Once the model has been saved, it can be used with drive.py using this command:

```sh
python drive.py model.h5
```

The above command will load the trained model and use the model to make predictions on individual images in real-time and send the predicted angle back to the server via a websocket connection.

Note: There is known local system's setting issue with replacing "," with "." when using drive.py. When this happens it can make predicted steering values clipped to max/min values. If this occurs, a known fix for this is to add "export LANG=en_US.utf8" to the bashrc file.

#### Saving a video of the autonomous agent

```sh
python drive.py model.h5 run1
```

The fourth argument, `run1`, is the directory in which to save the images seen by the agent. If the directory already exists, it'll be overwritten.

```sh
ls run1

```

The image file name is a timestamp of when the image was seen. This information is used by `video.py` to create a chronological video of the agent driving.

### `video.py`

```sh
python video.py run1
```

Creates a video based on images found in the `run1` directory. The name of the video will be the name of the directory followed by `'.mp4'`, so, in this case the video will be `run1.mp4`.

Optionally, one can specify the FPS (frames per second) of the video:

```sh
python video.py run1 --fps 48
```

Will run the video at 48 FPS. The default FPS is 60.

#### Why create a video

1. It's been noted the simulator might perform differently based on the hardware. So if your model drives succesfully on your machine it might not on another machine (your reviewer). Saving a video is a solid backup in case this happens.
2. You could slightly alter the code in `drive.py` and/or `video.py` to create a video of what your model sees after the image is processed (may be helpful for debugging).

### Tips
- Please keep in mind that training images are loaded in BGR colorspace using cv2 while drive.py load images in RGB to predict the steering angles.
